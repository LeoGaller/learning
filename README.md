## Important 
- [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/)
- Replace `hypermodern-python` with the name of your own repository, to avoid a name collision on 
PyPI.
- A virtual environment gives your project an isolated runtime environment, consisting of a specific
 Python version and an independent set of installed Python packages. This way, the dependencies of 
 your current project do not interfere with the system-wide Python installation, or other projects 
 youâ€™re working on.
